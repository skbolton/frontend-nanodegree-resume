## This is my resume for a Udacity Project

This project was a lot of fun for me because it was my first dive into using javascipt outside of exercises and challenges. I got to see the power in using javascript to populate the html on a webpage. I created javascript objects to hold my data and then iterate over them to populate fields. Over time I am going to do more and more with javascript to add to this resume!

### This is how the project template looked originally
All data populated in this photo was not in original project but these css styles were applied by their stylesheet
